1. First, take a grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Position the bar on your collarbone and drive your elbows upwards. 
3. Un-rack the bar, and take two steps back.
4. Then, check your stance is even with feet just outside shoulder width.
5. Take a deep breath, brace your core and lower under control into a full squat.
6. Think “sitting between your heels”, rather than “sitting back”.
7. Throughout the movement keep your elbows up and in to maintain the “shelf” for the barbell.
8. Once you hit the bottom position, drive back up through the mid-foot until you reach the start that one rep.
9. 6-8 reps per set, do 4 sets.
